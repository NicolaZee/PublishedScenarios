description.English=Arkham Crime Wave\n\nAn article in the Sunday newspaper catches your eye,\n <i>Arkham Crime Wave</i>.\nTwo murder victims in a week and both missing several bones.\nEven for Arkham, that is unusual.\nThe writer of the article, Kathleen Ross, claims the town is sinking into a cesspit of crime.\nA editorial comment by John Johnson blames the notorious O'Bannion gang.\n\nSpecial Notes\n\nArkham Crime Wave is a murder mystery.\nThe key evidence can be checked by examining items but\nnote-taking is recommended.\nIt is a sequel to the FFG scenario Gangs of Arkham.\nYou do not have to play Gangs of Arkham before playing.\nLike Gangs of Arkham, there is some 1920's slang.
