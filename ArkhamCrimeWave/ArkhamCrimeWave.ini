description.English=Arkham Crime Wave\n\nAn article in the Sunday newspaper catches your eye,\n <i>Arkham Crime Wave</i>.\nTwo murder victims in a week and both missing several bones.\nEven for Arkham, that is unusual.\nThe writer of the article, Kathleen Ross, claims the town is sinking into a cesspit of crime.\nA editorial comment by John Johnson blames the notorious O'Bannion gang.\n\nSpecial Notes\n\nArkham Crime Wave is a murder mystery set in the 1920's.\nThe key evidence can be checked by examining items but\nnote-taking is recommended.\nIt is a sequel to the FFG scenario Gangs of Arkham.\nYou do not have to play Gangs of Arkham before playing.\nLike Gangs of Arkham, there is some 1920's slang.\nThe characters may use language and express views typical of the 1920's but not condoned by the author.
