synopsys.English=Once again, the Silver Twilight is up to no good.  Can you stop their latest nefarious scheme?
description.English=This year the Silver Twilight society is organizing a Halloween festival.  It's advertised in the Arkham Echo as ghoulish fun for all the family with a parade around the town square ending with a spectacular spook show.  Is this a cover for yet another of their schemes and, if it is, can you stop them? \n\nThis scenario is a murder mystery.  It follows on from the scenarios in the Sanctum of Twilight expansion.\n\nA model vintage car that resembles a taxi may be useful as an optional prop.
