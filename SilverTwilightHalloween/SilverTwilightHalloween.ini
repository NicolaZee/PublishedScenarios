synopsys.English=Once again, the Silver Twilight is up to no good.  Can you stop their latest nefarious scheme?
description.English=This year the Silver Twilight society is organizing a Halloween festival.  It's advertised in the Arkham Echo as ghoulish fun for all the family with a parade around the town square ending with a spectacular spook show.  But is this event a cover for yet another sinster scheme and, if it is, can you stop them? \n\nThis scenario is a murder mystery.  Taking notes is recommended.  It uses characters from Behind Closed Doors.  If you want to play scenarios in a sequence, the recommended order is The Twilight Diadem, followed by Behind Closed Doors, followed by this scenario.\n\nA model vintage car may be useful as an optional prop.
