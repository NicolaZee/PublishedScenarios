synopsys.English=Investigate Professor Smith who is organising a new exhibition and clear your friend's name.
description.English=The reporter, Kathleen Ross, was investigating rumors exhibits at the Miskatonic Museum are coming to life. \nShe saw Professor Smith standing in the Lecture Hall chanting in an alien guttural language.\nThe next day she was arrested for theft of a relic.\nShe needs you help to clear her name and find out what the Professor is up to.\n\nIf the expansion 'Terror along the Nile' is enabled, the  'Exhibition Hall' and the 'Burial Chamber' medium tiles will be used and must be printed out.  Otherwise, the Path of the Serpent 'Side Exhibit 3' and 'Side Throne Room' medium tiles will be used instead.\n\nThis scenario follows on from the events of Arkham Crime Wave but you do not have to play that scenario to play this one.\nIf you have encountered Professor Smith, he is the same person unless he was killed or arrested; in which case he is his brother.\n\nOriginal puzzle code designed by Anton Timmermans.
