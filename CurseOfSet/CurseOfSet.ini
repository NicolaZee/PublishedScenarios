synopsys.English=Investigate Professor Smith who is organising a new exhibition and clear your friend's name.
description.English=The reporter, Kathleen Ross, was investigating rumors exhibits at the Miskatonic Museum are coming to life. \nShe saw Professor Smith standing in the Lecture Hall chanting in an alien guttural language.\nThe next day she was arrested for theft of a rare citrine snake statue.\nShe needs your help to clear her name, find out what the Professor is up to and recover the statue.\n\n<b>There is some translation of basic Hieroglyphs.  This has been simplified for game purposes and all information is accessible from the app.  Notepads may be useful and there are, also, 'Hint' buttons for extra help (if you need it).</b>\n\nIf the expansion 'Terror along the Nile' is enabled, the  'Exhibition Hall' and the 'Burial Chamber' medium tiles will be used and must be printed out.  Otherwise, the Path of the Serpent 'Side Exhibit 3' and 'Side Throne Room' medium tiles will be used instead.\n\nThis scenario follows on from the events of Arkham Crime Wave but you do not have to play that scenario to play this one.\nIf you have encountered Professor Smith, he is the same person unless he was killed or arrested; in which case he is his brother.
