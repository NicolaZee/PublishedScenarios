synopsys.English=Investigate Professor Smith who is organising a new exhibition and clear your friend's name.
description.English=Kathleen Ross, a reporter, was investigating rumors that exhibits at the Miskatonic Museum are coming to life.  She witnessed Professor Smith standing in the Lecture Hall chanting in a guttural alien language.  The next day, Kathleen was arrested for the theft of a citrine snake statue.  She needs your help to clear her name.\n\n<b>There is some translation of basic Hieroglyphs.  This has been simplified for gameplay purposes and all information is accessible from the app.  Notepads may be useful, and there are 'Hint' buttons to provide additional help, should you need it.</b>\n\nIf the expansion 'Curse of Set' is enabled, the custom 'Exhibition Hall' medium tile will be used and this tile must be printed out.  The Curse of Set package can be downloaded.\nhttps://github.com/NicolaZee/CoS_Package
